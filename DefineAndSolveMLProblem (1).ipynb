No feature selection is needed since there is only one feature, the reviews. Since this is text data there is no easily detectable outliers that need to be found and replaced and the data can not be scaled. To do the NLP preprocessing I will use the sklearn tf-idf Vectorizer. This vectorizer, converts all words into lowercase, performs tokenization, and then converts the words into numeric values using the tf-idf technique. The Tf-idf technique also helps by decreasing the weight of very common and very rare words. With NLP it could also be useful to remove stop words and perform lemmatization before perofrming the vectorization. "
